# Resources Directory Guide

This directory contains all runtime, packaging, database, and test assets for the example service.

If the Go code is the application logic, this folder is the operational contract around it: how it is configured, containerized, deployed, observed, and validated.

## What Problem This Folder Solves

Building a service is only half the work. Teams also need repeatable assets for:

- database setup and migrations,
- local and integration execution,
- OS/service manager integration,
- Debian and RPM packaging,
- observability dashboards,
- deterministic test fixtures.

This folder centralizes those concerns so developers and CI/CD pipelines use the same source of truth.

## Top Features (and Why They Matter)

- Multi-database support (MySQL and PostgreSQL)
	- Enables environment parity and easier migration between data stores.
- Flyway-ready migration layout
	- Makes schema changes versioned, auditable, and automatable.
- End-to-end test fixtures for local and integration modes
	- Reduces flaky tests and shortens feedback loops.
- Dual service boot support (systemd + SysV init)
	- Improves portability across modern and legacy Linux distributions.
- Packaging templates for both Debian and RPM ecosystems
	- Speeds up release engineering and standardizes installation behavior.
- Grafana dashboard template
	- Gives developers and operators immediate visibility into service health and performance.
