/*
Package decint provides utility functions to parse and represent decimal values
as fixed-point integers with a defined precision.

Values with at most six decimal places are stored as integers (scaled by 1e6)
to preserve deterministic behavior in comparisons, serialization, and transport.

The package provides bidirectional conversion between float64/string and scaled
int64 or uint64, fixed six-decimal output formatting, explicit parse errors for
invalid numeric strings, safe range constants (MaxInt and MaxFloat) for boundary
checks, and unsigned conversion helpers that clamp non-positive values to zero.

Implementation note:

  - float-to-integer conversion scales by 1e6 and rounds to the nearest
    integer (half away from zero), so extra fractional digits beyond the
    supported precision are rounded rather than truncated.

Safe range:

  - Values are safe up to MaxFloat = 2^33 = 8_589_934_592 with six exact
    decimal places. This is the largest magnitude at which a float64 still
    resolves a 1e-6 step (its ULP stays below 1e-6); beyond it the sixth
    decimal digit is no longer representable, so it is excluded from the safe
    range rather than rounded.
