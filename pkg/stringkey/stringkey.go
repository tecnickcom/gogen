/*
Package stringkey solves the practical problem of deriving a stable,
compact, non-cryptographic key from multiple text fields for fast lookup,
deduplication, and idempotency-style identifiers.

# Problem

Applications frequently need a deterministic key built from several strings
(for example: first name + last name + country, or provider + external ID +
scope). Building these keys manually is error-prone because equivalent inputs
may differ only by case, whitespace, or Unicode composition. stringkey applies
a canonical normalization pipeline before hashing so semantically equivalent
inputs map to the same key more often.

# How It Works

[New] builds a [StringKey] from one or more input fields using this pipeline:

 1. Trim leading and trailing Unicode whitespace for each field.
 2. Collapse repeated Unicode whitespace to a single space.
 3. Convert text to lowercase.
 4. Concatenate fields using a tab separator (`\t`) to preserve boundaries.
 5. Apply Unicode NFC normalization (equivalent to NFD then NFC).
 6. Hash the resulting byte sequence with FarmHash64.

The resulting key is stored as an internal uint64 and can be retrieved in
multiple representations:

  - [StringKey.Key]: raw uint64 value.
  - [StringKey.String]: base-36 string (short, variable length).
  - [StringKey.Hex]: fixed 16-character lowercase hexadecimal string.

Two normalization details are worth calling out:

  - Normalization is NFC, not NFKC. Canonically equivalent forms (such as
    precomposed vs decomposed accents) collapse together, but compatibility
    variants do not: ligatures (for example "ﬀ"), full-width vs half-width
    forms, and super/subscripts are left distinct.
  - Lowercasing uses the locale-independent [unicode.ToLower] simple mapping,
    not language-tailored case folding. For example, the Turkish dotless "ı"
    and dotted "İ" are not special-cased.

# Key Features

  - Deterministic canonicalization across case/spacing/Unicode variants.
  - Compact 64-bit key suitable for indexing and caching.
  - Multiple output formats for storage, logs, and URLs.
  - Fast, allocation-light hashing path for small field sets.

# Stability

For a fixed input, the key is fully deterministic and does not change across
runs, architectures, or Go versions: FarmHash64 is a fixed algorithm and the
representations are plain integer encodings.

The one dependency to be aware of is the Unicode normalization step, which uses
the Unicode data tables shipped by golang.org/x/text. Keys for pure-ASCII input
and for long-assigned characters are effectively permanent. Only rare or
newly-assigned code points can normalize differently if the golang.org/x/text
Unicode version advances, which would change their keys across such an upgrade.
If you persist keys and must survive Unicode-table upgrades unchanged, pin the
golang.org/x/text version alongside the stored keys.

# Important Limits

This package is not cryptographically secure and must not be used for security
tokens, signatures, or untrusted collision-resistant identifiers.

It is designed for reasonably small input sizes and a moderate number of keys.
According to the birthday bound for a 64-bit hash space (~1.8x10^19):

  - collision probability is about 1% around 6.1x10^8 generated keys;
  - collision probability is about 50% around 5.1x10^9 generated keys.

Choose a larger hash or cryptographic construction when your scale or threat
model requires stronger collision guarantees.
