/*
Package tsslice solves the common concurrency problem of safely operating on
Go slices shared across multiple goroutines without repeating lock boilerplate
around every access.

# Problem

Slices are lightweight and ubiquitous, but concurrent reads and writes to shared
slice state can cause data races and undefined behavior. In practice, teams end
up duplicating `Lock`/`Unlock` and `RLock`/`RUnlock` blocks around simple
operations (set, get, append, transform), making code noisy and increasing the
chance of forgetting synchronization on one code path.

tsslice provides lock-aware generic helpers that keep synchronization explicit
and consistent while preserving the ergonomics of slice utility operations.

# How It Works

Each function takes a pointer to the slice and a lock interface from
github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/threadsafe:

  - write operations ([Set], [SetOK], [Delete], [Append], [Do]) require
    [threadsafe.Locker] and use exclusive `Lock`/`Unlock`.
  - read and pure-transform operations ([Get], [GetOK], [Len], [Snapshot],
    [Filter], [Map], [Reduce], [RDo]) require [threadsafe.RLocker] and use shared
    `RLock`/`RUnlock`.

The helpers delegate functional operations to github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/sliceutil
while enforcing synchronization around the access.

# Key Features

  - Generic API for any slice type via `S ~[]E`.
  - Clear separation of mutation vs read/transform lock requirements.
  - Bounds-checked, non-panicking accessors ([GetOK], [SetOK]) alongside the
    idiomatic indexing forms ([Get], [Set]).
  - Atomic compound operations via [Do] (read-modify-write) and [RDo]
    (multi-step reads) for sequences a single helper cannot express.
  - [Snapshot] returns a consistent copy under the read lock for safe read-out.
  - Thread-safe functional utilities:
    [Filter], [Map], and [Reduce] for expressive transformations on shared
    slice state.
  - Minimal adoption cost: compatible with standard [sync.RWMutex] and custom
    lock implementations that satisfy the interfaces.

# Usage

	var (
	    mu sync.RWMutex
	    s  = []int{1, 2, 3}
	)

	tsslice.Set(&mu, &s, 0, 10)
	v := tsslice.Get(&mu, &s, 1)
	_ = v

	tsslice.Append(&mu, &s, 4, 5)
	even := tsslice.Filter(&mu, &s, func(_ int, n int) bool { return n%2 == 0 })
	total := tsslice.Reduce(&mu, &s, 0, func(_ int, n int, acc int) int { return acc + n })
	_ = even
	_ = total

# Concurrency

All helpers take the slice by pointer (`*S`) and dereference it only while
holding the lock. This includes [Append], which may reallocate the backing
array and reassign the slice. As a result, concurrent calls that share the same
slice variable and the same lock are safe by default: a reader observes a
consistent slice header even while another goroutine grows the slice.

Pass the address of the shared variable to every helper and route all access
through them using the same lock instance. Reading or writing the shared
variable directly (outside a helper and outside the lock) is still a data race.

Each helper acquires and releases the lock on its own, so a sequence of separate
helper calls is not atomic as a whole. Use [Do] (write) or [RDo] (read) to run a
compound operation — for example a conditional append or a multi-step scan —
under a single lock acquisition:

	var (
	    mu sync.RWMutex
	    s  = []int{1, 2, 3}
	)

	tsslice.Do(&mu, &s, func(sp *[]int) {
	    if len(*sp) < 4 {
	        *sp = append(*sp, 4)
	    }
	})

The predicate/transform callbacks passed to [Filter], [Map], [Reduce], [Do], and
[RDo] run while the lock is held. They must be cheap and non-blocking, and must
not call back into these helpers on the same lock: a write helper invoked from a
read-locked callback deadlocks, recursive read locking is not safe when a writer
is waiting, and any helper invoked under [Do]'s exclusive lock deadlocks
outright. A callback must also not retain the slice it receives (or the pointer
[Do] passes) beyond its own return: once the lock is released, reading or writing
that reference races with other goroutines.

[Filter] and [Map] return new slices, but any reference-typed elements they
contain remain shared with the original: the helpers protect the slice, not the
objects it points to.

# Guarded Wrapper

The free functions above require the caller to pair the right lock with the
right slice at every call site. [Guarded] is an optional higher-level type that
owns both a slice and its [sync.RWMutex], so access can only go through its
methods and a lock can never be mismatched or forgotten. Prefer it when a single
slice is the unit of sharing; keep the free functions when one lock must guard
several containers at once. Transforms to a different element type (Map/Reduce)
are expressed through [Guarded.RDo].
