/*
Package tsmap provides lock-aware generic helpers for operating on Go maps
shared across multiple goroutines, keeping synchronization explicit at every
call site.

# How It Works

Every function receives both the map and a lock interface from
github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/threadsafe:

  - write operations ([Set], [Delete], [Do]) require [threadsafe.Locker] and use
    `Lock`/`Unlock`.
  - read and pure-transform operations ([Get], [GetOK], [Len], [Snapshot],
    [Filter], [Map], [Reduce], [Invert], [RDo]) require [threadsafe.RLocker] and
    use `RLock`/`RUnlock`.

[Filter], [Map], [Reduce], and [Invert] delegate to
github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/maputil under the provided lock. The helpers
work with standard [sync.RWMutex] and any custom lock type that satisfies the
interfaces.

# Usage

	var (
	    mu sync.RWMutex
	    m  = map[string]int{"a": 1, "b": 2}
	)

	tsmap.Set(&mu, m, "c", 3)
	v, ok := tsmap.GetOK(&mu, m, "a")
	_ = v
	_ = ok

	even := tsmap.Filter(&mu, m, func(_ string, n int) bool { return n%2 == 0 })
	total := tsmap.Reduce(&mu, m, 0, func(_ string, n int, acc int) int { return acc + n })
	_ = even
	_ = total

# Determinism

Go map iteration order is randomized, so the transform helpers inherit the
semantics of github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/maputil: [Reduce] is deterministic
only when its reducing function is order-independent (for example commutative
and associative), and [Map] and [Invert] follow last-write-wins when several
input entries map to the same output key.

# Concurrency

Maps are reference types and no helper reassigns the caller's map variable, so
passing the map by value is safe: every helper serializes access to the shared
map through the provided lock. Route all access through the helpers using the
same lock instance; touching the map directly outside the lock is a data race.

Each helper acquires and releases the lock on its own, so a sequence of separate
helper calls is not atomic as a whole (a [GetOK] followed by a separate [Set] is
a classic check-then-act race). Use [Do] (write) or [RDo] (read) to run a
compound operation under a single lock acquisition:

	tsmap.Do(&mu, m, func(mm map[string]int) {
	    if _, ok := mm["k"]; !ok {
	        mm["k"] = 1
	    }
	})

The predicate/transform callbacks passed to [Filter], [Map], [Reduce], [Invert],
[Do], and [RDo] run while the lock is held. They must be cheap and non-blocking,
and must not call back into these helpers on the same lock: a write helper
invoked from a read-locked callback deadlocks, recursive read locking is not safe
when a writer is waiting, and any helper invoked under [Do]'s exclusive lock
deadlocks outright. A callback must also not retain the map it receives beyond
its own return: once the lock is released, reading or writing it races with other
goroutines.

[Filter], [Map], and [Invert] return new maps, but any reference-typed values
they contain remain shared with the original: the helpers protect the map, not
the objects it points to.

# Guarded Wrapper

The free functions above require the caller to pair the right lock with the
right map at every call site. [Guarded] is an optional higher-level type that
owns both a map and its [sync.RWMutex], so access can only go through its methods
and a lock can never be mismatched or forgotten. Prefer it when a single map is
the unit of sharing; keep the free functions when one lock must guard several
containers at once. Transforms to a different type (Map/Reduce/Invert) are
expressed through [Guarded.RDo].
