// sanitizeAttrsInline is the number of a record's attributes sanitizeRecord rebuilds without

// slogSanitizeHandler is a slog.Handler that resolves every attribute value once and repairs, in every
// record and in every set of attributes baked in with WithAttrs, the two shapes the standard library's
// handlers encode incorrectly.
//
// The first is a group that produces no field. Such a group writes nothing, but the standard library
// rolls the output buffer back to before it without calling closeGroup, so the state it cleared when
// opening the group is never restored. Under the JSON handler the attribute separator stays empty and
// the next attribute is written with no comma before it, making the line invalid JSON; under the text
// handler the group's name stays in the key prefix and the next attribute is silently written under the
// wrong key ("z=1" becomes "g.z=1"). It bites wherever a rendering attribute follows an elided group in
// the same buffer: among a record's attributes, inside another group, and within a single WithAttrs
// call — which is how Config.CommonAttr is applied, so a single elided group there corrupts every line
// the process writes. Dropping the group changes nothing about the output and sidesteps the bug. The
// filter is recursive: a group that is kept is rebuilt without any non-rendering subgroup it holds.
//
// The second is an attribute holding a time.Time whose year falls outside [0,9999]. slog's JSON encoder
// writes an "!ERROR:" string for it and then writes the value anyway (appendJSONTime does not return
// after the error), so one key carries two JSON strings and the line is invalid. Such a value is
// rewritten here as the RFC 3339 string the logsrv backend writes for it, which is the only rendering
// that keeps the line parseable and keeps the two backends agreeing. It is reachable from ordinary code
// — a deadline built by adding a large duration, or a time.Unix on a corrupt field.
//
// Only an *attribute*: a record's own timestamp is not one and never passes through here. It carries the
// same defect, and is repaired by the ReplaceAttr callback Config.SlogHandler installs (see
// replaceLevelName) — which is why a handler wrapped by NewSlogTraceIDHandler, where that callback is
// the caller's to supply, is not covered.
//
// Values are resolved here, and the resolved value is what is handed downstream — a LogValuer only
// yields its group once resolved, and a purely structural filter cannot see it (that mistake made this
// handler blind to the whole class). Substituting the resolved value keeps the cost at exactly one
// LogValue call per attribute per record: the handler below resolves again as it writes, and resolving
// an already-resolved value is a no-op. A LogValuer is therefore never invoked twice, and one whose
// result varies between calls cannot make this scan and that write disagree.
//
// It is installed above the trace handler rather than inside it (see Config.SlogHandler), for three
// reasons: it then runs whatever else is configured, including with TraceIDFn unset, where there is no
// trace handler to carry it; the trace handler receives records and derivations already filtered and
// resolved, so the trace ID it injects can never be the attribute that follows an elided group; and the
// per-record handler-chain replay a grouped logger performs runs below it, so it costs nothing there.
//
// The common attributes are the one set it cannot see — they are baked straight into the handler
// underneath — so Config.SlogHandler filters them itself before baking them.
//
// One rule it deliberately does not model: a ReplaceAttr callback that deletes an attribute (by
// returning the zero slog.Attr) can empty a group below this handler, re-creating the first defect.
// The filter cannot see a callback installed on a handler it merely wraps. Config.SlogHandler is
// unaffected — the only callback it installs is replaceLevelName, which never deletes — but a handler
// passed to NewSlogTraceIDHandler with a deleting ReplaceAttr is not protected (see attrRenders).

//
// Two deliberate deviations, both so the two backends render the same slog.Attr the same way:
//
//   - A group that resolves to zero members counts as writing nothing here, where slog writes it as a
//     bare "{}". Eliding is the rule both backends already document, and it is what keeps
//     WithGroup(TraceIDKey) from replacing the trace ID with an empty object.
//   - A nil-pointer error counts as writing nothing, where slog renders it as the string "<nil>". The
//     logsrv backend drops it too, so the two agree. Without this a typed nil — the commonest error bug
//     in Go — logged under TraceIDKey would be read as a caller-supplied trace ID, suppressing the
//     injected one and shipping the record correlated by the string "<nil>".
//
// Both are disclosed in the package documentation.
//
// The nil-error rule is unconditional here, and it has to be: this package cannot see zerolog, so it
// cannot make the answer depend on zerolog's interfaces or on its process-global ErrorMarshalFunc. The
// logsrv backend therefore drops a typed nil *before* consulting that hook (see its addErrEvent) rather
// than after, so both backends answer this question the same way whatever the hook is. The one shape

// this filter, blind to the hook, keeps one. That divergence is disclosed and cannot be closed here.
