/*
Package jwt provides an HTTP-oriented JWT authentication helper for
username/password login flows.

# Problem

Most services need the same authentication building blocks: validate user
credentials, issue short-lived signed JWTs, authorize protected endpoints from
an Authorization header, and optionally renew tokens near expiration. Wiring
this repeatedly across handlers is error-prone and often leads to inconsistent
claim handling and response behavior.

# Solution

This package wraps the core flow in a small API compatible with net/http:

  - [JWT.LoginHandler]: validates credentials and issues signed JWTs.
  - [JWT.RenewHandler]: renews a valid token only when it is close to expiry.
  - [JWT.IsAuthorized]: validates bearer tokens for protected handlers.
  - [JWT.Middleware]: wraps a handler, injecting verified claims into the
    request context for retrieval via [ClaimsFromContext].
  - [JWT.Authenticate]: validates a bearer token and returns its claims, for
    building custom middleware.
  - [JWT.IssueToken]: mints a token outside the HTTP login flow, once the
    caller has verified the user's identity by its own means.
  - [JWT.VerifyToken]: validates a raw token string that arrived over any
    transport (WebSocket messages, queue payloads, gRPC metadata).

Credential verification is fully delegated to a caller-provided
[VerifyCredentialsFn], so the package is agnostic to the password-hashing
scheme; use the OWASP-compliant github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/passwordhash
(Argon2id) for storage.

# Implementation

Tokens are RFC 7515 compact JWS with RFC 7519 claims, signed with HMAC-SHA2
(RFC 7518 §3.2: HS256, HS384 or HS512). The implementation is self-contained on
the Go standard library. Restricting the surface to
symmetric HMAC makes the classic JWT attacks (alg=none, asymmetric-to-HMAC
confusion) structurally impossible: the accepted algorithm is pinned and the
signature is verified before the claims payload is ever decoded. A `crit` header
(RFC 7515 §4.1.11) or a duplicated header parameter is rejected; other unknown
JOSE header parameters (typ, kid, ...) are ignored. The `exp` and `nbf` time
claims are validated (with optional leeway); `iat` is decoded but not validated,
as only a key holder could forge it.

# Authentication Flow

 1. The login endpoint decodes JSON credentials (`username`, `password`).
 2. A user-provided [VerifyCredentialsFn] checks them against the user store.
 3. On success, a JWT is signed with configured claims and returned as text.
 4. Downstream handlers validate `Authorization: Bearer <token>` via
    [JWT.IsAuthorized], [JWT.Middleware], [JWT.Authenticate], or
    [JWT.RenewHandler].

# Claims and Defaults

By default the package issues short-lived HMAC-signed tokens with:
  - expiration: [DefaultExpirationTime] (5 minutes)
  - renew window: [DefaultRenewTime] (30 seconds before expiry)
  - header name: [DefaultAuthorizationHeader] (`Authorization`)
  - request body cap: [DefaultMaxBodyBytes]
  - token size cap: [DefaultMaxTokenBytes]

Issued tokens include standard registered claims (`exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, `jti`,
`sub`) and an `auth_time` claim recording the original login. They support
optional `iss` and `aud` via options. The `sub` (Subject) claim is set to the
authenticated username. When `iss` and/or `aud` are configured, they are also
enforced during verification: a token missing them, or carrying different
values, is rejected.

# Extension Points

Functional options allow custom behavior without replacing core handlers:
  - response output customization ([WithSendResponseFn])
  - token/header settings ([WithExpirationTime], [WithRenewTime],
    [WithAuthorizationHeader], [WithSigningMethod], [WithMaxBodyBytes],
    [WithMaxTokenBytes])
  - session controls ([WithMaxSessionLifetime], [WithClockSkewLeeway])
  - key rotation ([WithPreviousKeys])
  - claim metadata ([WithClaimIssuer], [WithClaimAudience])
  - logger customization ([WithLogger])

# Security Notes

  - Only HMAC signing methods (HS256/HS384/HS512) are supported: the same
    symmetric key both signs and verifies. Keep it secret, and at least as long
    as the signing method's hash output (enforced by [New]).
  - To rotate the signing key without invalidating outstanding sessions, deploy
    the new key while listing the old one in [WithPreviousKeys], then drop the
    old key once the rotation window (expiration time plus renew window) has
    elapsed.
  - Return uniform error messages for invalid credentials to avoid account
    enumeration (the default login path already does this). A
    [VerifyCredentialsFn] MUST also equalize its own timing between known and
    unknown users so existence does not leak through response latency.
  - Use HTTPS so bearer tokens are never exposed in transit.
  - The handlers do not restrict the HTTP method; the caller is responsible for
    routing login to POST and protected endpoints appropriately.
  - Tokens are stateless: there is no server-side revocation before `exp`, and
    renewing a token does not invalidate the previous one, which stays valid
    until its own expiration. Configure short expiration windows appropriate
    for your threat model, and bound how long a session may be kept alive by
    renewals with [WithMaxSessionLifetime].
  - The package does not rate-limit or lock out repeated failed logins;
    brute-force protection (rate limiting, lockout, CAPTCHA) must be layered by
    the caller.
  - The default responder logs the full response body, including the issued
    token, at debug level. Where debug logs are retained, disable them or pass a
    redacting logger via [WithLogger] (see github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/redact,
    which detects JWT compact serializations).

# Benefits

This package gives services a concise, production-oriented JWT auth layer that
fits naturally into net/http while remaining configurable for real-world
requirements.
