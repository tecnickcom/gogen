/*
Package enumbitmap provides helpers to encode and decode enumeration values as
bitmaps.

It solves the problem of compactly representing sets of named flags using a
single integer, while still allowing easy conversion back to human-readable
values.

Each bit corresponds to a unique enumeration value. The package processes up to
32 bit positions (1<<0 through 1<<31), making it suitable for compact flag sets
and feature toggles.

Contract:

Enum IDs must be distinct single-bit powers of two in the range 1<<0 through
1<<31. An ID of 0, or any multi-bit value, cannot be represented as a set bit and
is therefore never produced by BitMapToStrings; such IDs make encoding and
decoding asymmetric and should be avoided. The value 0 always decodes to an empty
slice.

Portability:

Values are treated as the low 32 bits of a host int. Bit 31 is the sign bit on
platforms where int is 32 bits wide, so this package is intended for 64-bit
platforms; on a 32-bit build, inputs at or above 1<<31 behave in
implementation-defined ways and should be avoided.

Top features:

  - convert string slices to bitmap integers with StringsToBitMap
  - convert bitmap integers back to string slices with BitMapToStrings
  - report unknown names or bit positions with clear aggregated errors
  - preserve partial conversion results even when unknown values are found
    (useful for tolerant parsing and diagnostics)

Benefits:

  - compact in-memory and storage representation for enum sets
  - easy interoperability with bitmask-based APIs and database fields
  - predictable conversion behavior for both strict and best-effort workflows

Example with 8 bits:

	00000000 =   0 dec = NONE
	00000001 =   1 dec = FIRST
	00000010 =   2 dec = SECOND
	00000100 =   4 dec = THIRD
	00001000 =   8 dec = FOURTH
	00010000 =  16 dec = FIFTH
	00100000 =  32 dec = SIXTH
	01000000 =  64 dec = SEVENTH
	10000000 = 128 dec = EIGHTH
	00001001 = 1 + 8 = 9 dec = FIRST + FOURTH
