/*
Package mysqllock provides process-distributed mutual exclusion using MySQL's
named lock primitives GET_LOCK and RELEASE_LOCK.

[MySQLLock.Acquire] requests a lock by key and returns a [ReleaseFunc] that must
be called to release it.

Usage:

	db, err := sql.Open("mysql", dsn)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer db.Close()

	locker := mysqllock.New(db)
	release, err := locker.Acquire(ctx, "daily-reconciliation", 10*time.Second)
	if err != nil {
		if errors.Is(err, mysqllock.ErrTimeout) {
			// Another instance is holding the lock.
			return
		}

		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	defer func() {
		if err := release(); err != nil {
			log.Printf("failed to release lock: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Perform the critical section while lock is held.

# Detecting lock loss

A named lock lives only for as long as its owning MySQL session. If that session
is dropped (idle-timeout reaping by MySQL or an intermediary proxy, network
failure, server restart), MySQL releases the lock even though the caller still
holds a [ReleaseFunc]. To keep the session active a periodic keep-alive query is
run while the lock is held; if that query fails the lock is presumed lost. Each
keep-alive attempt is bounded by a per-attempt timeout ([WithKeepAlivePingTimeout],
default 10s), so a connection that hangs (rather than resets) is also detected as
lock loss instead of stalling silently.

Pass [WithLostLockHandler] to [MySQLLock.Acquire] to be notified (with an error
wrapping [ErrLockLost]) the moment a specific lock is lost, so the critical
section can be aborted:

	release, err := locker.Acquire(ctx, key, timeout,
		mysqllock.WithLostLockHandler(func(err error) {
			cancelCriticalSection() // stop work; the lock is no longer held
		}))

# Features

  - Single-call acquisition API: [MySQLLock.Acquire] returns a release closure,
    so lock lifetime can be scoped with defer. The returned closure is
    idempotent and safe to call more than once, including concurrently.
  - Explicit timeout handling: [ErrTimeout] is returned when GET_LOCK does not
    acquire the lock within the requested timeout.
  - Input validation: empty or over-long keys yield [ErrInvalidKey] and
    non-positive timeouts yield [ErrInvalidTimeout], instead of surfacing an
    opaque server error.
  - Dedicated lock connection: each successful lock acquisition is tied to a
    dedicated SQL connection, matching MySQL's lock semantics.
  - Connection keep-alive: a periodic query keeps the lock-owning connection
    active for long-running critical sections; the interval is configurable with
    [WithKeepAliveInterval] and each attempt is bounded by
    [WithKeepAlivePingTimeout].
  - Lock-loss notification: a keep-alive failure is reported through the
    per-acquisition [WithLostLockHandler] and the instance-wide
    [WithKeepAliveErrorHandler], both receiving an error wrapping [ErrLockLost].
    Handler panics are recovered so a faulty handler cannot crash the process.
  - Bounded release: releasing the lock uses its own timeout (configurable with
    [WithReleaseTimeout]) so a wedged connection cannot block the caller forever.
  - Context-aware acquisition: caller context controls acquisition cancellation.
  - Zero external dependencies at runtime: relies only on database/sql and
    MySQL lock functions.

# Behavior Notes

The lock key namespace is per MySQL server instance. Use stable, descriptive
keys (for example, "service:job:daily-reconciliation"). Always call the
returned [ReleaseFunc], ideally with defer, to avoid holding locks longer than
intended. MySQL limits lock names to 64 characters; keys outside 1..64
characters are rejected with [ErrInvalidKey].

If the returned [ReleaseFunc] is never called, the keep-alive goroutine and its
connection stay alive (and the lock stays held) until the process exits; there is
no finalizer backstop, so releasing is the caller's responsibility.

The GET_LOCK timeout is passed to MySQL with sub-second (fractional) precision;
MySQL 5.7.5 and later accept fractional timeouts (older servers truncate to
whole seconds). The timeout must be positive; a non-positive value is rejected
with [ErrInvalidTimeout] (MySQL would otherwise treat a negative timeout as an
effectively unbounded wait). This lock timeout is distinct from the caller
context: if ctx is canceled or its deadline is shorter than timeout, acquisition
fails with a wrapped context error rather than [ErrTimeout], so callers that
distinguish "held by another instance" from "my own deadline" should also test
for context errors.

Because a released connection is returned to the pool rather than closed, the
explicit RELEASE_LOCK is required to free the named lock. In the rare case where
RELEASE_LOCK fails on an otherwise-healthy connection, that connection can return
to the pool still holding the lock; the same is true if the caller context is
canceled at the instant GET_LOCK grants the lock (the acquire path issues a
time-bounded best-effort RELEASE_LOCK to mitigate this without delaying the
canceled acquisition, but cannot guarantee it if the connection is already
unusable). Releasing also relies on the driver leaving the connection usable
after canceling an in-flight keep-alive query. Configuring db.SetConnMaxLifetime
bounds how long any such leaked lock can persist.
