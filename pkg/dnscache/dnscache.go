/*
Package dnscache provides a local DNS cache that is safe for concurrent use,
bounded in size, and uses single-flight request collapsing to avoid duplicate
lookups.

It exposes [Cache.LookupHost] and [Cache.DialContext], a drop-in replacement for
an http.Transport DialContext.

# Caching

Resolved host names are cached for one cache-wide TTL; the authoritative DNS
record TTLs are not consulted. Concurrent callers asking for the same host share
a single lookup.

Host names are matched case-insensitively and an equivalent trailing dot (FQDN
form) is ignored, so "Example.com", "example.com" and "example.com." share a
single entry. A custom [Resolver] therefore observes the normalized name. Host
names that are already IP literals bypass the resolver and the cache entirely,
mirroring net.Resolver.LookupHost.

The configured size bounds the number of cached address sets, never the number of
distinct hosts looked up; [Cache.Len] can exceed it.

# Dialing

[Cache.DialContext] dials the resolved IPs sequentially (not raced) in the
resolver's preference order, interleaving address families (leading with the
resolver-preferred one) so a dead family is not exhausted before the other is
tried. Family-restricted networks ("tcp4", "udp6", ...) dial only addresses of the
matching family.

[WithDialer] configures the dialer, [WithDialTimeout] bounds each attempt, and
[WithAddressRotation] spreads connections across a host's records.

# Stale-if-error

[WithStaleOnFailure] serves the last successfully resolved addresses for a window
measured from the failed refresh, so rarely resolved hosts are protected too.
[WithStaleIfError] is the RFC 5861 variant, whose window is measured from the
addresses' original expiry.
