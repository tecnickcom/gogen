/*
Package periodic schedules a task function to run repeatedly at a fixed
interval, with optional random jitter and a per-invocation context timeout.

# Problem

Background workers that poll an external resource, flush a cache, or emit
heartbeats are common in production services. Implementing them correctly
requires handling context cancellation, per-call timeouts, graceful shutdown,
and the thundering-herd problem when many instances restart simultaneously.
Writing this loop from scratch every time is repetitive and error-prone.

# Solution

[New] constructs a [Periodic] scheduler from an interval, a jitter ceiling, a
per-call timeout, and a [TaskFn]. [Periodic.Start] runs the task in a dedicated
goroutine and [Periodic.Stop] shuts it down cleanly:

	p, err := periodic.New(
		30*time.Second,  // run every 30 s
		5*time.Second,   // add up to 5 s of random jitter
		10*time.Second,  // each call gets a 10 s deadline
		myTask,
	)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	p.Start(ctx)
	defer p.Stop()

# Features

  - Fixed interval with random jitter: the actual pause between calls is
    interval + rand(0, jitter), spreading load across a fleet and avoiding
    the thundering-herd problem
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).
  - Per-call timeout: each [TaskFn] invocation receives a [context.Context]
    derived from the parent with an independent deadline, preventing a single
    slow call from blocking the scheduler.
  - Context-aware shutdown: [Periodic.Start] accepts a parent context;
    canceling it (or calling [Periodic.Stop]) stops the loop after the
    current task invocation returns — no goroutine leaks.
  - Eager first execution: the first call fires after ~1 ns so the task runs
    immediately on start rather than waiting for the first full interval.
  - Simple API: three methods ([New], [Periodic.Start], [Periodic.Stop]) and
    one function type ([TaskFn]) cover the entire surface area.

# Constraints

  - interval must be > 0.
  - jitter must be >= 0 (pass 0 to disable jitter entirely).
  - timeout must be > 0.
  - task must not be nil.
  - task must not panic — it runs in the background goroutine with no recovery,
    so a panic crashes the process (recover inside the task if needed).

# Benefits

This package eliminates the recurring boilerplate of ticker-based background
loops in Go services, providing built-in jitter, cancellation, and timeout
handling in a minimal, dependency-free implementation.
