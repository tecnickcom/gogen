/*
Package redis provides helpers built on go-redis for common application
workflows: key/value storage, Pub/Sub messaging, typed payload encoding, and
connection health checks.

Redis reference: https://redis.io
Underlying client: https://github.com/redis/go-redis

# How It Works

[New] creates a [Client] given a [SrvOptions] (aliased from go-redis Options)
and a variadic list of [Option] values:

 1. The server address is validated before any network connection is attempted
    (skipped when a client is injected via [WithRedisClient], since no
    connection is dialed). Both TCP host:port addresses and unix domain
    sockets are supported.
 2. A go-redis client is constructed (or injected via [WithRedisClient] for
    tests). When at least one channel is declared with [WithChannels], a
    Pub/Sub subscription feeds [Client.Receive] and [Client.ReceiveData] one
    message per call. The subscription runs until [Client.Close] is called:
    canceling the [New] context does not stop it.
 3. Encode and decode functions (defaulting to [DefaultMessageEncodeFunc] and
    [DefaultMessageDecodeFunc]) are stored on the client and used
    transparently by the typed data methods.

# Operations

  - [Client.Set], [Client.Get], and [Client.Del] provide raw key/value access
    with expiration.
  - [Client.SetData] and [Client.GetData] encode and decode Go values with the
    configured [TEncodeFunc] and [TDecodeFunc].
  - [Client.Send] and [Client.Receive] carry raw strings; [Client.SendData] and
    [Client.ReceiveData] apply the same codec and return the channel name with
    the decoded value.
  - [WithMessageEncodeFunc] and [WithMessageDecodeFunc] replace the default
    codec.
  - [Client.HealthCheck] sends a PING and returns a wrapped error on failure.
  - A missing key surfaces as [ErrKeyNotFound]; other configuration and
    subscription states surface as the exported Err values, all matchable with
    errors.Is.
  - [WithRedisClient] injects a custom [RClient] for testing.
  - [Client.Close] releases Pub/Sub and client resources; it is idempotent and
    required to stop the subscription when channels are configured.

# Subscription Configuration

Use options to define Pub/Sub behavior at client creation time:

  - [WithChannels] to subscribe to channels.
  - [WithChannelOptions] to tune subscription channel behavior: buffer size,
    send timeout, and health check interval. With the go-redis defaults, a
    consumer that stops calling [Client.Receive] loses messages once the
    100-message buffer stays full for one minute.

# Usage

	srv := &redis.SrvOptions{Addr: "localhost:6379"}

	c, err := redis.New(ctx, srv, redis.WithChannels("events"))
	if err != nil {
	    return err
	}
	defer c.Close()

	if err := c.Set(ctx, "k", "v", 0); err != nil {
	    return err
	}

	if err := c.SendData(ctx, "events", event); err != nil {
	    return err
	}

	var event Event

	channel, err := c.ReceiveData(ctx, &event)
	if err != nil {
	    return err
	}

	if err := c.HealthCheck(ctx); err != nil {
	    return err
	}

To swap in an encrypted codec, supply custom functions at construction time:

	c, err := redis.New(ctx, srv,
	    redis.WithMessageEncodeFunc(myEncryptAndEncode),
	    redis.WithMessageDecodeFunc(myDecryptAndDecode),
	)
