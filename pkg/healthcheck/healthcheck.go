/*
Package healthcheck provides a framework for defining, executing, and
aggregating service health probes.

It standardizes health probing around three pieces:
  - [HealthChecker]: check contract (`HealthCheck(context.Context) error`),
    with [HealthCheckFunc] to adapt a plain function
  - [HealthCheck]: ID + checker registration unit
  - [Handler]: HTTP aggregator that runs checks concurrently and writes a
    combined result

The default handler response is JSON and maps each check ID to either "OK" or
the check error message.

# Aggregation Semantics

  - checks execute in parallel
  - overall HTTP status is 200 when all checks pass
  - overall HTTP status is 503 when any check fails
  - response payload always includes per-check results
  - a checker panic is recovered, logged, and reported as a failed check
  - with [WithTimeout], checks that overrun are reported as failed

Check IDs should be unique and non-empty: results are keyed by ID, so duplicate
or empty IDs collapse into a single entry (a warning is logged at construction).

Result-writing behavior is customizable via [WithResultWriter] to integrate
custom envelopes (for example JSendX) while keeping the execution model
unchanged.

# HTTP Probe Helper

[CheckHTTPStatus] is a helper for external HTTP dependencies. It supports
context timeout control and request customization via [WithConfigureRequest].

For an implementation example, see examples/service/internal/cli/bind.go.

// HealthCheckFunc adapts a plain function to the [HealthChecker] interface,
// mirroring the http.HandlerFunc pattern, so a function-based probe (such as one
// calling [CheckHTTPStatus]) can be registered without a wrapper type:
//
//	healthcheck.New("upstream", healthcheck.HealthCheckFunc(func(ctx context.Context) error {
//		return healthcheck.CheckHTTPStatus(ctx, client, http.MethodGet, url, http.StatusOK, 2*time.Second)

type HealthCheck struct {
	// ID is a unique identifier for the healthcheck.

}

// New creates a HealthCheck registration entry.
//
// It binds a stable check ID to a HealthChecker implementation so handlers can
// execute and report results consistently. The ID should be unique and
// non-empty within a handler, as results are aggregated by ID.
