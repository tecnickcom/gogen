/*
Package backoff computes successive retry delays with exponential growth, a
bounded maximum, and random jitter.

[Schedule] is a per-call delay calculator: given a base delay, a growth factor,
a jitter ceiling, and a maximum, each call to [Schedule.Next] returns the next
delay and advances the progression. It performs no timing, scheduling,
goroutines, or I/O; callers own their timers and loops and ask the Schedule for
the next duration.

[AddJitter] exposes the jitter step on its own for callers that pace work at a
fixed interval rather than backing off exponentially.

# Jitter strategies

By default a Schedule adds a fixed random ceiling ([JitterAdditive]); its
desynchronizing effect shrinks as the delay grows. [JitterFull] and
[JitterEqual] instead scale the jitter with the delay, decorrelating concurrent
clients at large delays. Select one via Config.Strategy.

# Bounds and overflow

Both the internal progression and the jitter addition are clamped so no delay
can overflow into a negative duration, regardless of factor, attempt count, or
configured maximum. The growth is capped below the int64 limit (~146 years),
and the jitter addition saturates at [math.MaxInt64] rather than wrapping.
Negative or NaN inputs are floored to zero.

Delays are computed in float64, so integer-nanosecond precision is exact only up
to ~2^53 ns (~104 days); beyond that a result may differ by a few nanoseconds.

# Usage

	s := backoff.New(backoff.Config{
	    Base:     100 * time.Millisecond,
	    Factor:   2,
	    Jitter:   50 * time.Millisecond,
	    MaxDelay: 30 * time.Second,
	})

	for {
	    // ... attempt work ...
	    time.Sleep(s.Next()) // 100ms, 200ms, 400ms, ... capped at 30s, each +[0,50ms)
	}

# Concurrency

A [Schedule] is stateful and must not be used concurrently; construct one per
retry sequence. [AddJitter] is a stateless function and is safe for concurrent
use.
