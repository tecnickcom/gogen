/*
Package random provides utility functions for generating random bytes, numeric
identifiers, UID/UUID values, hexadecimal/base36 IDs, and configurable random
strings.

# Randomness Source

By default, [New] uses [crypto/rand.Reader], which is suitable for
security-sensitive randomness. A custom [io.Reader] can be supplied directly to
[New] for testing or specialized environments.

The non-failing helpers ([Rnd.RandUint32], [Rnd.RandUint64] and [Rnd.UUIDv7],
plus [Rnd.RandHex64], [Rnd.RandString64], [Rnd.UID64] and [Rnd.UID128], which
are built on them) fall back to math/rand/v2 if the reader fails, so that their
signatures can stay error-free. [Rnd.RandomBytes] and [Rnd.RandString] never
fall back: they return the reader's error.

With the default [crypto/rand.Reader] the fallback is unreachable, because its
Read cannot return an error. It is reachable for a caller-supplied reader, and
it is silent by default: the entropy source is swapped without an error and
without a signal. Register [WithFallbackHook] to observe it. The fallback draws
from Go's OS-seeded ChaCha8 global source, so the output is not predictable, but
it is no longer the source the caller configured.

A reader that never makes progress (one that keeps returning zero bytes with a
nil error, or whose bytes are never usable) is not retried forever: the helpers
give up and report [ErrReaderNoProgress] rather than hanging.

# What It Provides

  - [Rnd.RandomBytes] for raw random byte slices.
  - [Rnd.RandUint32] and [Rnd.RandUint64] for random integers.
  - [Rnd.RandHex64] for fixed-length 16-char hexadecimal IDs.
  - [Rnd.RandString64] for compact base-36 IDs.
  - [Rnd.RandString] for random strings of length n using a configurable
    byte-to-character map.
  - [Rnd.UID64] for time-aware 64-bit unique identifiers ([TUID64]) with
    [TUID64.Hex] and [TUID64.String] formats.
  - [Rnd.UID128] for time+random 128-bit unique identifiers ([TUID128]) with
    [TUID128.Hex] and [TUID128.String] formats.
  - [Rnd.UUIDv7] for RFC 9562 UUID version 7 values ([UUID]).

# Character Map Customization

[Rnd.RandString] uses a default map containing digits, uppercase/lowercase
letters, and symbols. You can override it with [WithByteToCharMap].

The map is a map of bytes, not of runes: each output position is filled with one
byte drawn from it. Entries must therefore be single-byte (ASCII) values.

  - Multi-byte UTF-8 runes are not supported. A map containing them is not
    rejected, but its runes are split into their constituent bytes, which are then
    drawn independently, so the result is almost always invalid UTF-8.
  - Empty map input restores the default map.
  - Maps longer than 256 bytes are truncated to 256.
  - A single-entry map yields a constant string with no entropy.

# Usage

	r := random.New(nil) // default: crypto/rand.Reader

	id := r.RandHex64()
	short := r.RandString64()
	_ = id
	_ = short

	pwd, err := r.RandString(24)
	if err != nil {
	    return err
	}
	_ = pwd

	uid64 := r.UID64()
	uid128 := r.UID128()
	uuid := r.UUIDv7()
	_ = uid64.Hex()
	_ = uid128.String()
	_ = uuid.String()

	alphaNum := []byte("0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ")
	r2 := random.New(nil, random.WithByteToCharMap(alphaNum))
	_, _ = r2.RandString(16)
