/*
Package profiling bridges Go's built-in [net/http/pprof] profiling tool and the
[httprouter] request router, allowing all pprof endpoints to be served through a
single wildcard route without manual per-handler registration.

[PProfHandler] is a single [http.HandlerFunc] that reads an `*option` wildcard
parameter from the httprouter request context and dispatches to the correct
pprof handler. Registering one wildcard route is all that is needed:

	router.GET("/pprof/*option", profiling.PProfHandler)

# Supported Endpoints

The following pprof paths are handled after the wildcard prefix:

	/pprof/             - interactive index page listing all available profiles
	/pprof/cmdline      - running program's command line
	/pprof/profile      - 30-second (or ?seconds=N) CPU profile
	/pprof/symbol       - symbol lookup for program counters
	/pprof/trace        - execution trace (use ?seconds=N to set duration)
	/pprof/<name>       - any named runtime profile, e.g. heap, goroutine,
	                      allocs, block, mutex, threadcreate

The handler does not touch [http.DefaultServeMux], and it reads the endpoint
from httprouter's context parameter, so the mount prefix can be anything (for
example /debug/pprof/*option). Named profiles are forwarded to [pprof.Handler],
so no code changes are needed when the Go runtime adds new profiles.

# Caveats

The route's wildcard parameter must be named exactly [WildcardParamName]
("option"); [PProfHandler] reads that parameter to select the endpoint. A route
registered with a different wildcard name (e.g. /pprof/*path) would make the
handler serve the index page for every request.

The /pprof/profile and /pprof/trace endpoints block for the requested duration
(?seconds=N). Mount this handler on a route that is exempt from any per-request
timeout, otherwise long profiles are truncated. The
[github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/httpserver] integration disables the request
timeout for the pprof route for this reason.

The index page served at the empty path links to the other profiles using
relative URLs (e.g. heap?debug=1), so it must be reached at a path ending in a
slash (/pprof/). httprouter's default RedirectTrailingSlash handling redirects
/pprof to /pprof/, which keeps those links working; keep that redirect enabled.

# Security Note

pprof endpoints expose detailed internals of a running process (memory layout,
goroutine stacks, CPU traces). Mount this handler only on an internal or
administrative server that is not reachable from the public internet, and
protect it with authentication middleware appropriate for your environment.

# Integration

The [github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/httpserver] package registers
[PProfHandler] as the default pprof handler on its internal router. See
pkg/httpserver/config.go for a complete integration example.
