/*
Package kafka provides a pure-Go API for producing and consuming Apache Kafka
messages. It requires no CGO and no system librdkafka installation.

Built on github.com/segmentio/kafka-go, it exposes a producer/consumer
interface:

  - [NewProducer] + [Producer.Send] / [Producer.SendData]
  - [NewConsumer] + [Consumer.Receive] / [Consumer.ReceiveData]
  - [NewConsumer] + [Consumer.FetchMessage] / [Consumer.CommitMessages]

Functional options tune the session timeout, start offset, required acks,
batching, and custom codecs.

# Delivery Semantics

Producer writes wait for broker acknowledgment from the full in-sync replica
set by default (kafka.RequireAll); tune this with [WithRequiredAcks].

On the consumer side, when a consumer group is configured:

  - [Consumer.Receive] and [Consumer.ReceiveData] are at-most-once: the offset
    is committed as soon as the message is read, before the caller processes
    it, so a crash or decode failure after the read permanently skips the
    message.
  - [Consumer.FetchMessage] + [Consumer.CommitMessages] are at-least-once: the
    offset is committed only when the caller explicitly acknowledges the
    message after successful processing.

When no consumer group is configured (empty groupID), offsets are never
committed: [Consumer.Receive] and [Consumer.FetchMessage] behave identically,
reading always starts from the earliest available offset, and
[Consumer.CommitMessages] returns an error.

# Message Encoding and Decoding

Typed payload methods use configurable codec hooks:

  - [DefaultMessageEncodeFunc] powers [Producer.SendData]
  - [DefaultMessageDecodeFunc] powers [Consumer.ReceiveData]

Both defaults use github.com/tecnickcom/nurago/pkg/encode. Replace them via
[WithMessageEncodeFunc] and [WithMessageDecodeFunc] to add custom wire formats,
encryption, compression, or schema validation.

# Errors

Configuration problems are reported at construction time with errors matching
the exported sentinels [ErrInvalidOptions], [ErrNilEncodeFunc], and
[ErrNilDecodeFunc]. After [Consumer.Close], the receive methods return errors
matching [ErrConsumerClosed]. Match the sentinels with errors.Is.
