/*
Package sleuth provides a focused Go client for the Sleuth.io API, covering the
most common write-side integrations used for delivery metrics and operational
signal ingestion.

This package supports four Sleuth workflows:

  - deployment registration,
  - manual change registration,
  - custom incident impact registration,
  - custom metric impact registration.

Sleuth API reference:
https://help.sleuth.io/sleuth-api

# Problem

Integrating with Sleuth directly from raw HTTP calls involves repeated
boilerplate: endpoint formatting, authorization headers, JSON encoding,
request validation, retry handling, and response status checks. Recreating this
logic in each service increases maintenance cost and makes behavior inconsistent
across deployments.

This package centralizes that integration logic behind a typed client and
request models.

# How It Works

[New] initializes a [Client] with base URL, org slug, and API key, then builds
the endpoint URL templates used by each API action.

For each send operation:

 1. The request struct is validated using gogen's validator package and the
    tag rules declared on fields.
 2. The payload is JSON-encoded and sent as an authenticated HTTP POST
    (`Authorization: apikey <key>`).
 3. The request is executed through a write-oriented HTTP retrier.
 4. Non-200 responses are returned as errors with status details.

Health checks are implemented using Sleuth's documented behavior in absence of a
dedicated ping endpoint: the client performs a controlled registration call and
verifies expected 404 semantics and response content.

# Key Features

  - Typed request models with validation tags for safer API inputs.
  - End-to-end helpers:
    [Client.SendDeployRegistration], [Client.SendManualChange],
    [Client.SendCustomIncidentImpactRegistration],
    [Client.SendCustomMetricImpactRegistration].
  - Built-in authentication and JSON header management.
  - Configurable client behavior via options:
    [WithHTTPClient], [WithTimeout], [WithPingTimeout],
    [WithRetryAttempts], [WithRetryDelay].
  - Health-check API through [Client.HealthCheck] for readiness/liveness flows.

# Benefits

  - Faster and more consistent Sleuth integrations across services.
  - Reduced API misuse risk through validated typed payloads.
  - Better resilience to transient HTTP failures via retry support.
  - Cleaner application code by delegating protocol and endpoint details.

# Usage

	c, err := sleuth.New("https://app.sleuth.io/api/1", "my-org", apiKey)
	if err != nil {
	    return err
	}

	if err := c.HealthCheck(ctx); err != nil {
	    return err
	}

	err = c.SendDeployRegistration(ctx, &sleuth.DeployRegistrationRequest{
	    Deployment: "my-service",
	    Sha:        "abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12",
	})
	if err != nil {
	    return err
	}

This package is ideal for Go services that need a lightweight, production-ready
Sleuth API adapter without hand-writing HTTP integration code.
